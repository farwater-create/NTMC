# Never Too Much Create

Never Too Much Create (or NTMC for short) is a challenge modpack focused around the Create Mod. It adds most of the popular Create Mod Add-ons and mods like Applied Energistics 2, Powah!, Farmer's Delight and many more!

It also adds mods like Lithosphere and Nature's Spirit for better world generation.

For better performance we included mods like Sodium, Indium and Clumps.

If you ever get stuck we added quests to guide you along!
